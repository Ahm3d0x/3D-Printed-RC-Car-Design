# 🚗 3D Printed RC Car Design  

![Project Preview](./photo/main.png) <!-- يمكنك رفع صورة من تصميمك وتغيير الاسم -->

## 📖 About the Project
This project is a **3D printed RC car design**, fully modeled from scratch using 3D CAD tools.  
It started as a summer learning project to practice 3D modeling, and it became my biggest and most complete design so far 🚀.

The goal of this design is to provide a working prototype framework for an RC car, focusing on:
- Mechanical structure (chassis & frame)
- Gearbox design for torque enhancement
- Steering mechanism integration
- Component fitting with proper tolerances for 3D printing and assembly

## ⚙️ Features
- 🛠️ Fully designed from scratch (no templates used)  
- 🔩 Proper tolerances for **3D printing & assembly**  
- ⚡ Powered by **two DC motors (3V)** connected via a gearbox  
- 🎯 Steering controlled by a **servo motor**  
- 🚙 Rear-wheel drive system with synchronized front-wheel steering
